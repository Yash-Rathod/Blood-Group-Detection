# Blood-Group-Detection

This is one of the project for which I was very exited to work upon and received extreme support from the college and Doctors.

This image Classifier is trained to classify the Blood Group using the slides of blood. Model takes images in raw RGB form and transforms it into threshold-ed image and classifies it.
This model is trained from a custom dataset which was prepared with the help of a Doctor. That is why the data set is not uploaded in the repository.
You can refer the train.py for training details and classify.py for classifying procedure.
